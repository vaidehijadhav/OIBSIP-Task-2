        <p>Stephen Hawking was a world-renowned theoretical physicist, cosmologist, and 
        author who made groundbreaking contributions to our understanding of the universe. 
        He was born on January 8, 1942, in Oxford, England, and passed away on March 14, 2018, 
        at the age of 76.</p></div>
        
        <h2>Early life and education</h2>
        <p>Hawking grew up in a family of intellectuals, and he showed an early aptitude for science 
        and mathematics. He attended University College, Oxford, where he studied physics, and later
        earned his Ph.D. in cosmology from Trinity College, Cambridge. It was during his time at 
        Cambridge that Hawking was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive 
        neurodegenerative disease that eventually left him paralyzed and unable to speak without the 
        aid of a computerized voice synthesizer.</p>
    
        <h2>Contributions to Science</h2>
        <p>Despite his physical challenges, Hawking continued to make groundbreaking contributions to 
        the field of cosmology throughout his career. His most famous work was his theory of black hole 
        radiation, which suggested that black holes could emit energy and gradually shrink over time.
        This work challenged existing theories of the nature of black holes and helped lay the foundation
        for our current understanding of these mysterious objects.</p>
        <p>Hawking also wrote many popular science books that made complex scientific concepts accessible
        to a wider audience. His most famous book, "A Brief History of Time," has sold millions of copies
        worldwide and is widely regarded as one of the most important scientific works of the 20th century.</p>

        <h2>Stephen Hawking's books</h2>
        <ul class="heading">
          <li><strong class="name"><i>A Brief History of Time </i></strong>In 1988 Hawking released this informative 
           book about the overview of space, time, and the existence of god. This became an instant best
           seller , selling millions of copies.</li>
          <li><strong class="name"><i>The Universe in a Nutshell </i></strong><i>A Brief History of Time</i> also 
           wasn't as easy to understand as some had hoped. So in 2001, Hawking followed up his book with 
           <i>The Universe in a Nutshell</i>, which offered a more illustrated guide to cosmology's big theories.</li>
          <li><strong class="name"><i>The Grand Design </i></strong><i>The Grand Design</i> was Hawking's first major 
           publication in almost a decade. Within his new work, Hawking set out to challenge Sir Isaac 
           Newton's belief that the universe had to have been designed by God, simply because it could 
           not have been born from chaos. "It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper 
           and set the universe going," Hawking said.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Legacy and Impact</h2>
        <p>Hawking's contributions to science and popular culture were widely recognized and celebrated 
        throughout his life. He was awarded numerous honors and awards, including the Albert Einstein 
        Medal, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and a knighthood from Queen Elizabeth II. In addition, 
        he was the subject of many documentaries, books, and films, and his life and work inspired countless
        people around the world.</p>
        <p>Stephen Hawking passed away on March 14, 2018, but his legacy continues to inspire future 
        generations of scientists, thinkers, and innovators. He showed us that even in the face of seemingly 
        insurmountable challenges, we can still make meaningful contributions to the world and make a lasting 
        impact.</p>
